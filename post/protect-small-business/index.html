	<p>For the past few weeks, we’ve seen our favorite restaurants close their doors, our neighbors lose their jobs, friends and family struggle to make ends meet and we thought, “What can we do to help?” We decided to use the best resource we have - our ability to tell stories and give a voice to people who need it most.</p><p>As a company, we have been fortunate enough to film with small businesses both in our backyard and across the globe. The small business owners we’ve met have welcomed us into their homes, given us an intimate look at the companies they’ve poured their hearts and souls into, and entrusted us to tell some of their most personal stories. It has been one of the greatest privileges of our lives to meet these extraordinary people.</p><p>We’re optimists and storytellers, and we’re hoping that by sharing their stories along with practical ways that you can help, we can protect these small business leaders and the families they support.</p><p>These are their stories.</p><p></p><h2 id="highway-innhttpswwwmyhighwayinncom"><a href="https://www.myhighwayinn.com/">Highway Inn</a></h2><p>Oahu, HI</p>

	<p>To bring much-needed cheer into Jenny Doan’s life after she lost her life savings in the 2008 stock market crash, her children bought her a sewing machine. Jenny started posting YouTube sewing tutorials and soon amassed a faithful following who tuned in to learn her tried-and-true quilting tips and tricks. Jenny opened a brick-and-mortar location that carried the fabric and materials used in her video tutorials, and Missouri Star Quilt Co. quickly grew to become the world’s largest provider of precut fabrics. The Doan family has temporarily closed their shops due to public health safety reasons, but they are still safely staffing their factory to meet the demand of online orders (while making sure to properly space out employees to ensure everyone stays safe). Missouri Star Quilt Co. has not laid off any of its 400 team members, and they are still producing video content so that both novice and expert quilters can make the most of their time at home.</p><h3 id="how-you-can-help">How You Can Help:</h3><p>• Watch one of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MissouriQuiltCo"><strong>Jenny’s tutorials on YouTube</strong></a> (and share the link with a friend who loves quilting!)<br>• Purchase fabric and materials online from <a href="https://www.missouriquiltco.com/"><strong>Missouri Star Quilt Co.</strong></a><br>• Find out if your local hospital is seeking surplus face masks.

For over 73 years, the owners—including current co-owner Ed Dollive and his daughter and son-in-law, Travis and Chrissie Semblewski— have used recipes passed down from the family matriarch. Beloved for its welcoming environment and homemade pastas, pizzas, and entrees, Vic’s Italian Restaurant has long been a popular gathering spot.

	<p>Nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, Fort Payne, Alabama was once known as the “Sock Capital of the World,” with over 300 mills that employed half the town. When textile manufacturing began to move overseas in the early 2000s, the small town suffered a massive economic downturn. Determined to carry on Fort Payne’s rich sockmaking heritage, Gina Locklear opened Zkano Socks, a family-owned business that knits certified organic cotton socks in small batches. Sales have recently decreased since the boutiques selling the product have closed in the wake of COVID-19, but the company is still fulfilling online orders as well as through curbside service at its mill.</p><h3 id="how-you-can-help">How You Can Help:</h3><p>• Buy socks online from <a href="https://zkano.com/"><strong>Zkano’s website</strong></a>… and maybe surprise a friend with a pair!<br>• Post pictures of your Zkano socks on Instagram and tag <a href="https://www.instagram.com/zkano_socks/?hl=en"><strong>Zkano</strong></a> so your friends can learn about their products too<br>• Purchase a <a href="https://zkano.com/products/gift-card"><strong>gift card</strong></a><br>• Sign up for the <a href="https://zkano.com/pages/rewards"><strong>rewards program</strong></a>.

	<p>Unable to find high-quality halal meat options in New York City, three friends—Russell Khan, Bassam Tariq, and Khalid Latif—banded together to open a butcher shop and burger joint with meat sourced from farmers in the tri-state area.

Their wellness-based business quickly took off, and by the beginning of 2020 they had a team of 12 and two warehouses - one in San Diego and one in LA. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit Southern California, they lost about 90% of their sales overnight and had to temporarily lay off more than half their team. Instead of being defeated, they adapted by creating a website offering free doorstep delivery to homes in their local area. Functioning as a modern-day Milkman service (except with healthier beverages and products), the Kombucha on Tap team is now offering free doorstep delivery to homes in Encinitas, Carlsbad, Vista, Oceanside, and San Marcos as well as dropping off surprise growlers of kombucha and cold brew coffee to health care workers and first responders who are the real heroes right now.</p><h3 id="how-you-can-help-1">How You Can Help:</h3><p>• <a href="https://orderkombucha.com/"><strong>Order free doorstep delivery</strong></a> if you live in North County San Diego or get drive-up pickup at the Vista warehouse.
